                <h2>It All Starts with You</h2>
                <p>You will be amazed at the thoroughness of our new patient exam. At Glisten Dental, this means
                    personal
                    attention from our team of doctors, assistants and hygienists. They will provide you with a complete
                    assessment of your oral health while listening to your concerns and answering your questions. Most
                    importantly, they will develop a plan to return your smile to its optimal condition.</p>
                <p>You will receive a complete evaluation of the health of your teeth, gums and jaw. This starts with
                    all necessary digital x-rays and an oral cancer screening. We continue by capturing a series of high
                    definition photos of your mouth – so you can see what we see. And, we evaluate the health of
                    existing crowns, inlays, onlays, dentures or partial dentures.</p>

                        for itself. The highest-quality care to get the perfect results. I'm a
                        physician in hospital medicine, and I feel like I've been treated like
                        the best. The staff is all wonderful and friendly. I would highly
                        recommend Dr. Mohr if you need anything done."

                        professional and personable and Dr. Mohr is super talented. I had an old
                        Maryland bridge replaced and he did such a great job that you wouldn't
                        even know I had bridges. The teeth matched and formed my smile perfect.
                        I will recommend him to everyone! I'm so happy now I can smile in
                        confidence.”
